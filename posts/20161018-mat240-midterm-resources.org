Team,

I hope you have had a productive and refreshing weekend, so
that tomorrow you get to grips and fully engage with the
midterm exam.

A table with the problems from Friedberg et al, recommended
by Professor Meinrenken since the beginning of the term, is
now up on the [[https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1][ut.umu page]].

You may also find the link to Terry Tao's LA course webpage
in the same section, where sample and actual midterms with
solutions are given.

I wish you good luck and lucid state of mind tomorrow.

Onwards!

-- sasha
