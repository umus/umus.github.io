Team,

I hope you are having a productive week.

This is to remind you that this Friday we are going to have a session
in the usual place, BA026, seminar room, Bahen, at 16:10.

I am aware that some people may have a test tomorrow, so it is
understandable if you choose to miss a session.

I would be really grateful if you could think about what you want to
do to spend it productively. For RA, Joe have recommended the following problems
from Spivak:

pp. 108-110:  #3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 19;

p. 120:  #4, 9, 10;

pp. 130-131: #2, 5, 8, 10, 11;

p. 139:  #1, 2;

pp. 163-165: #1, 11,  16;

pp. 182-183:  #4, 8, 9

If you had finished those, it would be great to hear your
suggestions.

To avoid misunderstanding, the session is planned to be split into
two, and, as usual, you get separate CCR points for attending both
parts. However, if you think it is useful to have a (l)ong session
just devoted to RA, please send me a short email saying "l" in the
subject or body.

On top of that, I would also like to remind you that Joe is holding a
review session today, November 10, in Bahen 6180 from 15:00 to 16:00.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Onwards,

-- sasha
