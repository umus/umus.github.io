Team,

I hope you are having a productive exam period.

With 3 people who have answered (thank you, Lola, Matthew and
Vanessa), I wonder if we wish to meet today, as usual, at 16:10 in
Bahen, B026 (seminar room), for a practice session.

Could you please tell me if this time suits you? Do you have any
suggestions, wishes or any secret longings regarding the session you
would like to share?

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Good luck to all of you who have an exam today!

Onwards!
