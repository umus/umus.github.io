Team, 

In the tense time of midterms, I hope you feel composed and ready for
new challenges.

I will not be able to attend the session today due to an exam, but
there are still vacant classrooms you can go to and eager communities
you can join.

For example, Gal Gross and Putnamites are meeting today, March 3rd, in
BA 4010 from 16:00 to 20:00 to plow through Chapter 2 of "Putnam and
Beyond".

If you are looking for a spare room, here is the link to the
availability calendar:
