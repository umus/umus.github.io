Team,

I am writing to remind you that this Friday, October 14, we are going
to have our second meeting in B026(seminar room), Bahen, at 16:10.

There are several updates this week.

First, Yooveshen Mooroogen, who decided to join our sessions, has
suggested a list of recommended problems from Spivak as given in the
MAT157 syllabus of 2012-2013. The table adapted from the syllabus has
been published on the ut.umu page.

Secondly, ACE of UToronto got back to me about the request of
reserving B026 for our sessions. In order to have such a privilege, we
need to [[https://ulife.utoronto.ca/page/view/slug/apply][recognize our group with ULife]] first. The exact procedure will
be investigated in detail after the midterms; there are several
options available. For example, we may try to collaborate with Math
Union. I will contact Angela shortly.

Finally, there are several talks [[https://www.facebook.com/events/1609525922683111/][organized by the Math Union]] at the
time of our meeting on Friday, from 16:30. The topics include the
following:

- /Why Some Sequences are More Special than Others/ by Calder
  Morton-Ferguson

- /The Chromatic Number of the Plane and the Axiom of Choice/ by Angela Wu

- /Sphere Packing and the Baffling Properties of the $$E_8$$ and Leech
  Lattices/ by Zachary Karry

If there is any interest, I will find out whether this may count as an
academic experience in the context of CCR. If not, it sounds
interesting anyway. Please let me know what you think.

If you intend to come earlier than 16:10 on Friday, the schedule on
ACE for B026 shows that the room is going to be vacant after 15:00.

If you have any resources relevant to our agenda, for example lecture
outlines from any week, please let me know and I will post them on the
ut.umu page. Please also take a look at the MAT240 course page,
where several bonus problems have been already posted.

I am looking forward to seeing you on Friday.

Onwards!

-- sasha
