Team,

I am writing to remind you that today
the session is going to take place at
the usual time, 16:10, in the usual
place, B026 (seminar room), Bahen.

The preliminary plan is to split the
session into two, one for analysis and
one for algebra, but if you have any
other ideas in mind, please do not
hesitate to propose them during the
session. And it would be great to hear
any problems or questions you might want
to discuss together!

Good luck to all of you who have a
midterm today.

Onwards!

-- sasha
