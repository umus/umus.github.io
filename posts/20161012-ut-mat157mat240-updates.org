Team,

This is a follow-up to [[https://umus.github.io/log/20161012-ut-mat157mat240-notices.html][the announcement made earlier]].

The curator of recognized study groups has confirmed that attending
the CUMC talks organized by the Math Union on Friday at 16:30 in
BA2135 counts as an academic experience eligible for CCR.

You can learn more about the talks on the [[https://mu.math.toronto.edu/home/blog/2016/10/12/math-union-presents-three-cumc-talks/][MU website]].

Since I am responsible for registering the participants of the study
group attending the academic experience events, I must be present at
either the study session or the CUMC talks to make the session or the
academic experience recognized.

Thus, I would be grateful to hear your opinions on whether you would
prefer to go to the talks or have a study session. To make it easier
for you to reply and save some time for math, please choose one of the
following options and write me an email with its one-letter code:

  (s) Study Session
  (t) CUMC Talks

There are several members whose exams overlap with the study session
this Friday. It is fine if you leave a bit early or come a bit late,
provided you still find value in the session or talks.

Moreover, there are three talks, each lasting 20 minutes, and, if most
of us decide to go to the talks, you can come to any one of those to
make it count as an academic experience.

I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Onwards!
