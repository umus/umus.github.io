* Wir müssen wissen — wir werden wissen.

Knowledge is power. The ability to learn, create and share knowledge
is the ability all of us have.

But using this ability requires deliberate practice and courage.

umu, which stands for universal math umu and is read as $$u$$-$$\mu$$,
is the framework to facilitate the progress of mathematics.

Through discourse, invention, organisation of math circles and
seminars, problem-solving and independent research, umu strives to
improve the mathematical culture and foster creative boldness of those
who dare to wonder.
