Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am grateful to all of you who have come today. In the session we
were happy to welcome Janice in our circle!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With regards to the problem that Saminul suggested, the following are
several links which I hope you might find interesting:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(1) &lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1882069/why-does-polynomial-factorization-generalize-to-matrices"&gt;Generalization of the Polynomial Factorization to Matrices&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(2) &lt;a href="http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Axler139-154.pdf"&gt;Proof that Every Operator over a Finite-dimensional Complex Vector Space has an Eigenvalue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a great weekend!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today we plan to meet at 16:10 at an unusual place – room 4010 in
Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also added a book on the treatment of linear algebra via
exterior products to the resource page on ut.umu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know some interesting applications of MVT, intuitive
visualizations of dual spaces or stories about Diogenes and his
friends, you are more than welcome to share them with us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to remind you that today
the session is going to take place at
the usual time, 16:10, in the usual
place, B026 (seminar room), Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The preliminary plan is to split the
session into two, one for analysis and
one for algebra, but if you have any
other ideas in mind, please do not
hesitate to propose them during the
session. And it would be great to hear
any problems or questions you might want
to discuss together!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have a
midterm today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive and reinvigorating weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You may find the following past MAT157 exams worthwhile to look at for
the midterm tomorrow:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0203/157AnalysisI/TermExam2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2002-2003 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0304/157AnalysisI/TE2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2003-2004 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0405/157AnalysisI/TE2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2004-2005 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also updated the ut.umu page with the advice from Özgür
Esentepe and the photo from the last session on Friday, November 11. I
am grateful to all of you for your dedication and creative boldness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is to remind you that this Friday we are going to have a session
in the usual place, BA026, seminar room, Bahen, at 16:10.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am aware that some people may have a test tomorrow, so it is
understandable if you choose to miss a session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I would be really grateful if you could think about what you want to
do to spend it productively. For RA, Joe have recommended the following problems
from Spivak:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 108-110:  #3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 19;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
p. 120:  #4, 9, 10;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 130-131: #2, 5, 8, 10, 11;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
p. 139:  #1, 2;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 163-165: #1, 11,  16;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 182-183:  #4, 8, 9
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you had finished those, it would be great to hear your
suggestions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To avoid misunderstanding, the session is planned to be split into
two, and, as usual, you get separate CCR points for attending both
parts. However, if you think it is useful to have a (l)ong session
just devoted to RA, please send me a short email saying "l" in the
subject or body.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, I would also like to remind you that Joe is holding a
review session today, November 10, in Bahen 6180 from 15:00 to 16:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards,
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to inform you about the results of the questionnaire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Out of 7 people whose responses I have received, 6 individuals have
confirmed their availability on Friday, and all of those 6 have chosen
the talks. Thus, the plan is to go to the talks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Considering the last two days of exciting events in the Fields
Institute, I would be happy to hear the opinions and reflections from
all of you who have managed to join the Bhargavalia. Moreover, if you
are really excited about all the mathemagic you have witnessed and
want to share the oumph with your knowledge-thirsty peers, we can
devote one of the next sessions, perhaps after the analysis midterm,
to your findings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forwards to seeing you in BA2135 at 4:00 pm on Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am glad to inform you that last Friday we have had the largest session so far,
with 17 people attending at least the first part of the
session. Welcome to Allan Chang, Agyness Chen, Mrunal Gavali and Shuting
Zhang!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope that you have found something useful in this session, and I
hope that you have been inspired to bring your own questions next
time. It was illuminating to see the way Lola, Thomas, Matthew, Fiona
and Alan think while solving problems, and I dare to claim that their
boldness has been integral to the flow of the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As Matthew have promptly suggested, this Friday, November 4, MUGS III
talks are going to take place in BA2135 from 16:00 to 18:00. Professor
Burchard, who has interests ranging from geometric problems in
functional analysis, PDE and probability symmetrization to sharp
inequalities scheduling and delay analysis in communication networks,
will be giving a talk on the fruitful topic of symmetries and
reflections, with applications to minimization problems. For example,
we may look at the following question: starting from the north pole,
can we reach any point on the sphere by applying iteratively a finite
set of reflections?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We need to decide on our plan for Friday. If you prefer the talks to
the session, please send me a quick reply with the letter "t" in the
body or the subject of the email. If you, on the other hand, would
rather have a session and skip the talk, please send me the letter
"s". I will write you back with the results as soon as I get a
representative number of replies. Note that the talks will be counted
as an academic experience for the MAT240 study group (last time the
talks were counted as an academic experience for MAT157), which is one
of the requirements for getting CCR by the end of the term.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a side note, if you have a github account and wish to contribute
any notes, handouts or any other material to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/umus/ut.umu"&gt;ut.umu repository&lt;/a&gt;,
please drop me an email with your account name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wish you a productive week and look forward to hearing from you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a good night sleep so that you are ready for yet
another wonderful and productive Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are amazing news – Shuting Zhang and Allan Chang have expressed
their interest in our sessions, and I hope they will be able to come
to today at 16:10, B026 (seminar room) in Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As always, it would be beneficial for the entire group if you could
think about questions you wish to ask during the session, any problems
you are curious about or any exciting mathematical adventures you have
been involved with that you can share with us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today, similarly to the last time, the preliminary plan is to split
the session into two parts, one devoted to analysis and one to linear
algebra, but there is room for any suggestions you might have.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also added some information to the ut.umu page about CCR that
you can receive by attending the sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am extremely grateful to all of you who have come today and made the
session productive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It has been a pleasure to study in the environment full of initiative
and support. Thanks to all of you who have asked questions, dared to
be confused and took a risk of showing what and how they think in
front of a dozen of peers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have found something useful in the session today. If not,
it would be great to hear what might have been done better. And the
suggestions of interesting topics or problems you may wish to add to
the agenda in the future are hugely welcomed!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Following the discussion of the Nested Interval Theorem, which turns
out to be a consequence of &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorsIntersectionTheorem.html"&gt;Cantor's Intersection Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, here is the
problem from Spivak with which the Intermediate Value Theorem can be
proven differently from how it has been done in class:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Suppose $$f$$ is continuous on $$[a, b]$$ and $$f(a) &amp;lt; 0 &amp;lt; f(b)$$.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then either $$f(\frac{a + b}{2}) = 0$$,
or $$f$$ has different signs at the end points of $$[a, \frac{a+b}{2}]$$,
or $$f$$ has different signs at the end points of $$[\frac{a + b}{2}, b]$$.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If $$f(\frac{a + b}{2}) \neq 0$$, let $$I_1$$ be one of the two
intervals on which $$f$$ changes sign. Now bisect $$I_1$$. Either $$f$$
is $$0$$ at the midpoint, or $$f$$ changes sign on one of the two
intervals. Let $$I_2$$ be such an interval. Continue in this way, to
define $$I_n$$ for each $$n$$ (unless $$f$$ is $$0$$ at some
midpoint). Use the Nested Interval Theorem to find a point $$x$$ where
$$f(x) = 0$$.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have a refreshing weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to remind you that we are planning to meet today at 16:10
in B026 (seminar room), Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As we have decided earlier, the session is going to be split into two,
one devoted to LA, and one to RA.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I would be extremely grateful if in the meantime you could think about
any questions you want to ask for the common discussion, any topics
you wish to be covered, and whether there is any material you are
willing to tell the group about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, it would be exciting to learn from those of you who are
going through (have finished?) Baby Rudin and have studied Chapters
I-IV how our dear Walter treats continuity through metric spaces,
provided it is possible to compact the highly alluring lecture into
our time limits. Of course, it would be great to hear about any other
topic you find useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are also updates to the MAT157 Resources section of the ut.umu
page, where the Companion Notes to PMA by Professor Evelyn Silvia have
been added.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to seeing you today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have a midterm today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
