Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the tense time of midterms, I hope you feel composed and ready for
new challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will be able to attend the session today due to an exam, but there
are still vacant classrooms you can go to and eager communities you
can join.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, Gal Gross and Putnamites are meeting today, March 3rd, in
BA 4010 from 16:00 to 20:00 to plow through Chapter 2 of "Putnam and
Beyond".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are looking for a spare room, here is the link to the
availability calendar:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope your exams are going well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all the activities, events and preparations, the most active
participants of our sessions have, there is a considerably lesser
number of us who will probably come to the session today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are eager to meet, please drop me an email. Otherwise, there
are lots of other opportunities where you can spend your time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, there is an introductory tutorial to P vs NP organised by
UofT Undegraduate Theory Group and given by Eric Bannatyne
(&lt;a href="http://ericbannatyne.ca/"&gt;http://ericbannatyne.ca/&lt;/a&gt;) in BA3116 from 14:00 to 15:00. Moreover,
there is a Putnam-style problem-solving session organised by Gal Gross
in BA4010 from 17:00 to 19:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to Lola, who sets off to a battle in a big winterguard
competition, and Thomas, grappling with MUN, and to each one of you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet today at 3.00 pm in BA4010, as usual, for more
problem-solving and knowledge-sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010 for joyful problem
solving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also a talk at 17:00 organized by MU in Room 1190 which you
might find interesting:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"The hallway problem considers adjacent parallel hallways of unit width
each with a single doorway (aligned with integer lattice points) of unit
width. It then asks: what are the properties of lines that pass through
each doorway? Configurations of doorways closely correspond to Sturmian
words, and so properties of these configurations may be lifted to
properties of Sturmian words. This talk will explore lines of sight, lines
that pass through each doorway, for both the case for both a finite number
of parallel hallways and an infinite number, and their consequences for
Sturmian words. We then produce a metric on configurations with an
infinite number of hallways that preserves the property of admitting a
line of sight under limits."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
!新年快乐
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are still eager to plunge into some more problem solving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010. Straight after our
session, at 17:00, there is a talk in BA1170 on meets and greets –
ahem – knots and graphs, given by Katie Walsh, for whom it is one of
the tests required to work at UofT. So we are lucky!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For all of you interested in doing some problems together, I suggest
we meet in BA4010 tomorrow at 15:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a Putnam Club running at 17:00 in the same room as well, so
we will finish by then and thus will have an opportunity to attend the
VI MUG talk, given by Dr. Brendan Kelly on  "How many ways to the coffee
house?".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems",- said
Rényi, so you might as well give a shot to the talk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy New Year!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a great break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also hope that we are ready to
continue our investigative climb.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow, on Friday 13, I suggest we
meet in BA1220 at 3 pm. Please note the
change of time and place – it seems
that this room is the only one in Bahen
which suits our needs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have any comments or suggestions,
please feel free to write me or reply to
all in order to make your message
visible to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you also want to win special prizes
as most active participants, in order to
kickstart our seminar work, please
present some problems tomorrow which you
find exciting or (nota bene: not xor)
confusing and which you are eager to
grapple with during the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
See you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you enjoy the pastime relatively
free from pressure of mandatory
activities. Let me add yet another such
activity to your schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all the great work you have done
this semester, to be recognized on the
CCR it is necessary to complete a
reflection at

Thank you for your fruitful engagement.

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive exam period. For your interest,
there are past MAT240 exams from various sources published on the
&lt;a href="https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1"&gt;ut.umu page&lt;/a&gt; in the MAT240 Resources section.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With 3 people who have answered (thank you, Lola, Matthew and
Vanessa), I wonder if we wish to meet today, as usual, at 16:10 in
Bahen, B026 (seminar room), for a practice session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Could you please tell me if this time fits your schedule? Do you have
any suggestions, wishes or any secret longings regarding the session
you would like to share?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have an exam today!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thank you to all of you who have replied!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lola has expressed the options nicely:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not on a weekend, and
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Either of:
– On a Friday, or
– One, but not both, of:
    — On a Tuesday, xor
    — Before 3:30pm
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[ ~(weekend) ] ∧ [ (Friday) ∨ [ (Tuesday) ⊻ (Before 3:30pm) ] ]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know also that there are exams some of us have on December 14 and
15, so December 13 to 15 including are probably not the best days to
hold the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unless you have already done so, could you please tell me whether
you are interested in meeting up at any time noted above?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a productive day!
&lt;/p&gt;
