Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
!新年快乐
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are still eager to plunge into some more problem solving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010. Straight after our
session, at 17:00, there is a talk in BA1170 on meets and greets –
ahem – knots and graphs, given by Katie Walsh, for whom it is one of
the tests required to work at UofT. So we are lucky!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For all of you interested in doing some problems together, I suggest
we meet in BA4010 tomorrow at 15:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a Putnam Club running at 17:00 in the same room as well, so
we will finish by then and thus will have an opportunity to attend the
VI MUG talk, given by Dr. Brendan Kelly on  "How many ways to the coffee
house?".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems",- said
Rényi, so you might as well give a shot to the talk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy New Year!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a great break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also hope that we are ready to
continue our investigative climb.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow, on Friday 13, I suggest we
meet in BA1220 at 3 pm. Please note the
change of time and place – it seems
that this room is the only one in Bahen
which suits our needs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have any comments or suggestions,
please feel free to write me or reply to
all in order to make your message
visible to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you also want to win special prizes
as most active participants, in order to
kickstart our seminar work, please
present some problems tomorrow which you
find exciting or (nota bene: not xor)
confusing and which you are eager to
grapple with during the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
See you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you enjoy the pastime relatively
free from pressure of mandatory
activities. Let me add yet another such
activity to your schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all the great work you have done
this semester, to be recognized on the
CCR it is necessary to complete a
reflection at

Thank you for your fruitful engagement.

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive exam period. For your interest,
there are past MAT240 exams from various sources published on the
&lt;a href="https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1"&gt;ut.umu page&lt;/a&gt; in the MAT240 Resources section.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With 3 people who have answered (thank you, Lola, Matthew and
Vanessa), I wonder if we wish to meet today, as usual, at 16:10 in
Bahen, B026 (seminar room), for a practice session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Could you please tell me if this time fits your schedule? Do you have
any suggestions, wishes or any secret longings regarding the session
you would like to share?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have an exam today!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thank you to all of you who have replied!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lola has expressed the options nicely:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not on a weekend, and
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Either of:
– On a Friday, or
– One, but not both, of:
    — On a Tuesday, xor
    — Before 3:30pm
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[ ~(weekend) ] ∧ [ (Friday) ∨ [ (Tuesday) ⊻ (Before 3:30pm) ] ]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know also that there are exams some of us have on December 14 and
15, so December 13 to 15 including are probably not the best days to
hold the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unless you have already done so, could you please tell me whether
you are interested in meeting up at any time noted above?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a productive day!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thank you to all of you who came last Friday. Even though we broke up
into two groups working in different rooms, I hope it was productive
for you. On my part, I am sorry if I failed to secure a good space for
us all – the list of rooms showed that B026 was busy during our
session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to elaborate on our plan of preparation for the final.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since all the regular lectures are finished or going to be finished
this week, I wonder whether we want to organize joint preparation
sessions before December 17. I know that some people solve problems
together anyway, and I would be glad if we could join our efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are up for the idea, could you please write me a short email
with the days and time periods you find suitable for meeting together?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are ready for the productive end of the week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today the plan is to meet at 16:10 in room 4010, Bahen, as usual, and
discuss all the exciting questions you might have – and come up with
them as well!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am grateful to all of you who have come today. In the session we
were happy to welcome Janice in our circle!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With regards to the problem that Saminul suggested, the following are
several links which I hope you might find interesting:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(1) &lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1882069/why-does-polynomial-factorization-generalize-to-matrices"&gt;Generalization of the Polynomial Factorization to Matrices&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(2) &lt;a href="http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Axler139-154.pdf"&gt;Proof that Every Operator over a Finite-dimensional Complex Vector Space has an Eigenvalue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a great weekend!
