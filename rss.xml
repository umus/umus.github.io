Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive exam period. For your interest,
there are past MAT240 exams from various sources published on the
&lt;a href="https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1"&gt;ut.umu page&lt;/a&gt; in the MAT240 Resources section.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With 3 people who have answered (thank you, Lola, Matthew and
Vanessa), I wonder if we wish to meet today, as usual, at 16:10 in
Bahen, B026 (seminar room), for a practice session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Could you please tell me if this time suits you? Do you have any
suggestions, wishes or any secret longings regarding the session you
would like to share?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have an exam today!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thank you to all of you who have replied!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lola has expressed the options nicely:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not on a weekend, and
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Either of:
– On a Friday, or
– One, but not both, of:
    — On a Tuesday, xor
    — Before 3:30pm
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[ ~(weekend) ] ∧ [ (Friday) ∨ [ (Tuesday) ⊻ (Before 3:30pm) ] ]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know also that there are exams some of us have on December 14 and
15, so December 13 to 15 including are probably not the best days to
hold the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unless you have already done so, could you please tell me whether
you are interested in meeting up at any time noted above?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a productive day!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thank you to all of you who came last Friday. Even though we broke up
into two groups working in different rooms, I hope it was productive
for you. On my part, I am sorry if I failed to secure a good space for
us all – the list of rooms showed that B026 was busy during our
session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to elaborate on our plan of preparation for the final.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since all the regular lectures are finished or going to be finished
this week, I wonder whether we want to organize joint preparation
sessions before December 17. I know that some people solve problems
together anyway, and I would be glad if we could join our efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are up for the idea, could you please write me a short email
with the days and time periods you find suitable for meeting together?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are ready for the productive end of the week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today the plan is to meet at 16:10 in room 4010, Bahen, as usual, and
discuss all the exciting questions you might have – and come up with
them as well!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am grateful to all of you who have come today. In the session we
were happy to welcome Janice in our circle!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With regards to the problem that Saminul suggested, the following are
several links which I hope you might find interesting:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(1) &lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1882069/why-does-polynomial-factorization-generalize-to-matrices"&gt;Generalization of the Polynomial Factorization to Matrices&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(2) &lt;a href="http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Axler139-154.pdf"&gt;Proof that Every Operator over a Finite-dimensional Complex Vector Space has an Eigenvalue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have a great weekend!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today we plan to meet at 16:10 at an unusual place – room 4010 in
Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also added a book on the treatment of linear algebra via
exterior products to the resource page on ut.umu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know some interesting applications of MVT, intuitive
visualizations of dual spaces or stories about Diogenes and his
friends, you are more than welcome to share them with us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to remind you that today
the session is going to take place at
the usual time, 16:10, in the usual
place, B026 (seminar room), Bahen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The preliminary plan is to split the
session into two, one for analysis and
one for algebra, but if you have any
other ideas in mind, please do not
hesitate to propose them during the
session. And it would be great to hear
any problems or questions you might want
to discuss together!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to all of you who have a
midterm today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive and reinvigorating weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You may find the following past MAT157 exams worthwhile to look at for
the midterm tomorrow:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0203/157AnalysisI/TermExam2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2002-2003 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0304/157AnalysisI/TE2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2003-2004 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0405/157AnalysisI/TE2/Exam.html"&gt;MAT157 2004-2005 Midterm 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also updated the ut.umu page with the advice from Özgür
Esentepe and the photo from the last session on Friday, November 11. I
am grateful to all of you for your dedication and creative boldness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are having a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is to remind you that this Friday we are going to have a session
in the usual place, BA026, seminar room, Bahen, at 16:10.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am aware that some people may have a test tomorrow, so it is
understandable if you choose to miss a session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I would be really grateful if you could think about what you want to
do to spend it productively. For RA, Joe have recommended the following problems
from Spivak:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 108-110:  #3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 19;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
p. 120:  #4, 9, 10;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 130-131: #2, 5, 8, 10, 11;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
p. 139:  #1, 2;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 163-165: #1, 11,  16;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
pp. 182-183:  #4, 8, 9
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you had finished those, it would be great to hear your
suggestions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To avoid misunderstanding, the session is planned to be split into
two, and, as usual, you get separate CCR points for attending both
parts. However, if you think it is useful to have a (l)ong session
just devoted to RA, please send me a short email saying "l" in the
subject or body.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, I would also like to remind you that Joe is holding a
review session today, November 10, in Bahen 6180 from 15:00 to 16:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards,
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am writing to inform you about the results of the questionnaire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Out of 7 people whose responses I have received, 6 individuals have
confirmed their availability on Friday, and all of those 6 have chosen
the talks. Thus, the plan is to go to the talks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Considering the last two days of exciting events in the Fields
Institute, I would be happy to hear the opinions and reflections from
all of you who have managed to join the Bhargavalia. Moreover, if you
are really excited about all the mathemagic you have witnessed and
want to share the oumph with your knowledge-thirsty peers, we can
devote one of the next sessions, perhaps after the analysis midterm,
to your findings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forwards to seeing you in BA2135 at 4:00 pm on Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;
