Team,

Happy New Year!

I hope you have had a great break.

I also hope that we are ready to
continue our investigative climb.

Tomorrow, on Friday 13, I suggest we
meet in BA1220 at 3 pm. Please note the
change of time and place -- it seems
that this room is the only one in Bahen
which suits our needs.

If you have any comments or suggestions,
please feel free to write me or reply to
all in order to make your message
visible to everyone.

If you also want to win special prizes
as most active participants, in order to
kickstart our seminar work, please
present some problems tomorrow which you
find exciting or (nota bene: not xor)
confusing and which you are eager to
grapple with during the session.

See you soon.

Onwards!
