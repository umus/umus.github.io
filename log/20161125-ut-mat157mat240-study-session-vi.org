Team,

I hope you are having a productive week.

Today we plan to meet at 16:10 at an unusual place -- room 4010 in
Bahen.

If you know some interesting applications of MVT, intuitive
visualizations of dual spaces and stories about Diogenes and his
friends, you are more than welcome to share them with us.

Hope to see you there.

Onwards!

-- sasha
