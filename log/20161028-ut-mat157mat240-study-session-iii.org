Team,

I hope you have had a good night sleep so that you are ready for yet
another wonderful and productive Friday.

There are amazing news -- Shuting Zhang and Allan Cheng have expressed
their interest in our sessions, and I hope they will be able to come
to our session today at 16:10, B026 (seminar room) in Bahen.

As always, it would be beneficial for the entire group if you could
think about the questions you want to ask during the session, any
problems you are curious about or any exciting mathematical adventures
you have been involved with that you can share with us.

Today, similarly to the last time, the preliminary plan is to split
the session into two parts, one devoted to analysis and one to linear
algebra, but there is room for any suggestions you might have.

I have also added some information to the ut.umu page about CCR that
you can get by attending the sessions.

I am looking forward to seeing you soon.

Onwards!

-- sasha
