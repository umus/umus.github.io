Team,

I am grateful to all of you who have come today. In the session we
were happy to welcome Janice in our circle!

With regards to the problem that Saminul suggested, the following are
several links which I hope you might find interesting:

(1) [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1882069/why-does-polynomial-factorization-generalize-to-matrices][Generalization of the Polynomial Factorization to Matrices]]

(2) [[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Axler139-154.pdf][Proof that Every Operator over a Finite-dimensional Complex Vector Space has an Eigenvalue]]

Have a great weekend!
