Knowledge is power. The ability to learn, create and share knowledge
is the ability all of us have.

But using this ability requires practice and courage.

umu (read as $$u$$-$$\mu$$) is the framework to facilitate the
progress of mathematics.

Through discourse, exposition, organisation of math circles and
seminars, deliberate practice of problem-solving and independent
research, umu strives to improve the mathematical culture and foster
creative boldness.
