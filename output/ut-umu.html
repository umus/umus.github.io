<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<i>The following are the suggestions from the participants regarding</i>
<i>the sessions</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The text is reproduced exactly as it has been received</i>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't interrupt when ppl talking , be polite, don't spend too much
time on one single question. Don't judge, don't copy but actually
know how to do the question. Be productive. Don't be too serious but
don't be too casual.
</li>

<li>Work through extra Spivak chapters, work through baby Rudin if we
are confident in our MAT157 material. I would also like to work on
MAT240 if everyone is okay with that because I'm less confident in
that material.
</li>

<li>Rule: Be prepared! Everybody should be familiar with the
material we are discussing. AND do not idle for more than 3
minutes. It’s time-killing and may distract other people.
</li>

<li>Topics Interested:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Course Materials, these things are fundamental.
</li>
<li>Further discussion based on Complex Numbers, e.g. Laurent expansion
</li>
<li>Number Theory, Probability, and much more.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I'm mostly interested reviewing the week's lectures and working on
relevant problems to cement our understanding of the material. Like
some of us mentioned tonight, I think questions from Spivak,
Prof. Meinrenken's bonus questions, and problem sets/tests from
previous years are good places to start. I'm open to looking at
other topics if other people are interested, but my primary concern
is mastery of the material at hand.
</li>

<li>I think it might be useful to identify our topics of discussion a
few days ahead of time so everyone has sufficient time to prepare
and come up with questions, discover areas of confusion, etc.
</li>

<li>We could also consider inviting one of the profs to a part of our
session sometime, since we're such a large group. They'd probably
appreciate the enthusiasm.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">20161014: CUMC Talks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can't decide which talk I liked best! They were all great. I
was especially impressed that i felt like i understood most of
what they said. Which was deceptive, but still.
</li>

<li>I had a really good time at the CUMC talks, I didn't really know
what to expect going in. I've never gone to a talk not hosted by a
professor, I was very happy with the talks.

<p>
Zach's talk was excellently done, despite the topic being
advanced(i.e. required a lot of mathematical machinery? A term I
learned during the talk), but it addressed a question that was not
difficult to understand. It's was really cool, and inspiring to
see someone, who is not so different from me and my peers
understand all this, and be able to give such a talk. Upon
reflection, maybe this is the point of these talks, to give us a
realistic role model as undergrads. Zach used a lot of cheesy
audience participation stuff which ended up being great, didn't
formally define the lattice which was a really good call, and as a
result I found the progression of ideas easy to follow. I was
interested the whole way through.
</p>

<p>
Angela's was kind of crazy, she had a lot to say. I found the talk
hard to follow, and honestly, I got lost a few times. The
question(Hadwiger Nelson problem?) wasn't very clear to me, I
still don't really understand what a colouring is, or what it
means for a graph to be coloured. I ended up googling Moser's
spindle during the talk because I had no idea why a construction
like that could end up informing the problem. I think the source
of the confusion was that I wasn't sure what we were trying to
figure out, so I didn't see the motivation behind the steps that
we were taking. In the end, the main point seemed to be that the
axiom of choice was very powerful. I think there's a lot of people
who would be very interested in the result she showed on the
board, but it was all pretty meaningless to me. I felt mildly
inspired to go home and read about ZFC and other things, but I
don't really feel like I can explain to anyone else anything about
either the hadwiger nelson or what the axiom of choice means. This
is probably expected however, these aren't simple concepts, and
time and my knowledge are limited, maybe I'm not in the intended
audience of the talk (What's measure?).
</p>

<p>
Calder's talk was hugely interesting to me, the death of a
sequence joke was a great touch. I understood the motivation
behind the problem, and while I got lost during the definition of
the meta-fibonnaci sequence after he worked out a few of the terms
on the chalkboard, I was back on track. I think above all else, it
was COOL. I have a bit of history trying to read Hofstadter, and I
thought the result was hugely unintuitive and therefore
interesting (similarly, the leech lattice and e8 lattics? totally
unexpected and interesting). There was a lot to think about, and I
feel I can explain the topic to others. I thought this was great.
</p>

<p>
General comments: It was nice to get some idea of what actually
doing math looks like, what type of problems they try to solve
(totally random ones!). The whole role model thing seemed to be a
theme. The talks were definitely interesting, and were fun to talk
about with non-math friends after. I think that Zach's talk was
the best, and Calder's is the one which interested me most.
