Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have a wonderful last week of March!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today the room BA3116 is free from 3 pm to 5 pm, so we can meet together and solve problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please note that this week the room is different!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Gal Gross is also going to have a session today in BA 4010 between 5-7
pm to continue working through Chapter 3 on Analysis in "Putnam
Beyond". He also hints that the problems we are going to look at may
be more challenging than usual.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a wonderful week so far.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today the room BA4010 is free from 3 pm to 5 pm, so we can meet
together and solve problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Gal Gross also organises the Putnam Session, which today is going to
focus on analysis from 5 pm to 7 pm. As Gal intriguingly says, "If you
wanted to attend the meetings but have been putting it off, waiting
for the "right moment" to join, this will be an excellent time to jump
in!".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With regards to the legendary VIth problem we have tried to solve in
the most recent session, you can learn more about the story behind it
and find hints and solutions here:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y30VF3cSIYQ"&gt;Legend of Question VI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Vj_7Y2-xY"&gt;The Return of the Legend of Question Six&lt;/a&gt; – with some geometric
intuition behind why the problem works&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta_jumping"&gt;Vieta Jumping&lt;/a&gt; – here is the description of one of the methods,
which Terry Tao has referred to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Could you please tell me whether you are interested in meeting today
at 3 pm in BA4010?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are, a short one-letter "y" reply would suffice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a wonderful week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since there is a math review session booked in 4010 today until
16:00, I suggest we meet at 15:00 in the undergraduate specialist
lounge on the 6th floor of Bahen – there is a chalkboard and enough
space for 6 people. If there is a greater demand for space, we can
move to GB119, in which there is nothing scheduled today from 15:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also a concert of Indian classical music given by
Dr. Purnaprajna Bangere (&lt;a href="https://www.purnaviolin.com/repertoire"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;page), a professor of mathematics and
music at University of Kansas, and others from 19:00 to 21:00 today
in the MacLeod Auditorium, Medical Sciences Building.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, the seventeenth annual undergraduate mathematics competition
will be written on Sunday, March 12, beginning at 11 am, in
BA1170. Anyone can participate. If you are interested, please register
for the contest by sending an email to Professor Barbeau, at
barbeau@math.toronto.edu. Past papers are here: 
&lt;/p&gt;

Onwards!

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the tense time of midterms, I hope you feel composed and ready for
new challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will not be able to attend the session today due to an exam, but
there are still vacant classrooms you can go to and eager communities
you can join.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, Gal Gross and Putnamites are meeting today, March 3rd, in
BA 4010 from 16:00 to 20:00 to plow through Chapter 2 of "Putnam and
Beyond".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are looking for a spare room, here is the link to the
availability calendar:

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope your exams are going well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all the activities, events and preparations, the most active
participants of our sessions have, there is a considerably lesser
number of us who will probably come to the session today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are eager to meet, please drop me an email. Otherwise, there
are lots of other opportunities where you can spend your time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, there is an introductory tutorial to P vs NP organised by
UofT Undegraduate Theory Group and given by Eric Bannatyne
(&lt;a href="http://ericbannatyne.ca/"&gt;http://ericbannatyne.ca/&lt;/a&gt;) in BA3116 from 14:00 to 15:00. Moreover,
there is a Putnam-style problem-solving session organised by Gal Gross
in BA4010 from 17:00 to 19:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good luck to Lola, who sets off to a battle in a big winterguard
competition, and Thomas, grappling with MUN, and to each one of you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you have had a productive week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet today at 3.00 pm in BA4010, as usual, for more
problem-solving and knowledge-sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!

Team, 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010 for joyful problem
solving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also a talk at 17:00 organized by MU in Room 1190 which you
might find interesting:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"The hallway problem considers adjacent parallel hallways of unit width
each with a single doorway (aligned with integer lattice points) of unit
width. It then asks: what are the properties of lines that pass through
each doorway? Configurations of doorways closely correspond to Sturmian
words, and so properties of these configurations may be lifted to
properties of Sturmian words. This talk will explore lines of sight, lines
that pass through each doorway, for both the case for both a finite number
of parallel hallways and an infinite number, and their consequences for
Sturmian words. We then produce a metric on configurations with an
infinite number of hallways that preserves the property of admitting a
line of sight under limits."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
!新年快乐
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope you are still eager to plunge into some more problem solving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010. Straight after our
session, at 17:00, there is a talk in BA1170 on meets and greets –
ahem – knots and graphs, given by Katie Walsh, for whom it is one of
the tests required to work at UofT. So we are lucky!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see you there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;

Team,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For all of you interested in doing some problems together, I suggest
we meet in BA4010 tomorrow at 15:00.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a Putnam Club running at 17:00 in the same room as well, so
we will finish by then and thus will have an opportunity to attend the
VI MUG talk, given by Dr. Brendan Kelly on  "How many ways to the coffee
house?".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems",- said
Rényi, so you might as well give a shot to the talk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Onwards!
&lt;/p&gt;
