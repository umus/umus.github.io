Team,

!新年快乐

I hope you are still eager to plunge into some more problem solving.

I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010. Straight after our
session, at 17:00, there is a talk in BA1170 on meets and greets --
ahem -- knots and graphs, given by Katie Walsh, for whom it is one of
the tests required to work at UofT. So we are lucky!

Hope to see you there.

Onwards!

-- sasha
