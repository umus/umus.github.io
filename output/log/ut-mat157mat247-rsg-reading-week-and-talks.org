Team,

I hope your exams are going well.

With all the activities, events and preparations, the most active
participants of our sessions have, there is a considerably lesser
number of us who will probably come to the session today.

If you are eager to meet, please drop me an email. Otherwise, there
are lots of other opportunities where you can spend your time.

For example, there is an introductory tutorial to P vs NP organised by
UofT Undegraduate Theory Group and given by Eric Bannatyne
(http://ericbannatyne.ca/) in BA3116 from 14:00 to 15:00. Moreover,
there is a Putnam-style problem-solving session organised by Gal Gross
in BA4010 from 17:00 to 19:00 in BA4201.

Good luck to Lola, who sets off to a battle in a big winterguard
competition, and Thomas, grappling with MUN, and to each one of you.

Onwards!

-- sasha
