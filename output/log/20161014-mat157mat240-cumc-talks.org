Team,

I am grateful to all of you who have promptly reacted to the quick
questionnaire either in person or by mail.

Out of 6 of those who replied, 6 wish to go or at least /check out/
the talks.

I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at 16:30 in BA2135.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact me,
it would be extremely refreshing to hear what you think.

Onwards!

-- sasha
