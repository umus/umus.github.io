Team, 

I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010 for joyful problem
solving.

There is also a talk at 17:00 organized by MU in Room 1190 which you
might find interesting:

"The hallway problem considers adjacent parallel hallways of unit width
each with a single doorway (aligned with integer lattice points) of unit
width. It then asks: what are the properties of lines that pass through
each doorway? Configurations of doorways closely correspond to Sturmian
words, and so properties of these configurations may be lifted to
properties of Sturmian words. This talk will explore lines of sight, lines
that pass through each doorway, for both the case for both a finite number
of parallel hallways and an infinite number, and their consequences for
Sturmian words. We then produce a metric on configurations with an
infinite number of hallways that preserves the property of admitting a
line of sight under limits."

Onwards!
