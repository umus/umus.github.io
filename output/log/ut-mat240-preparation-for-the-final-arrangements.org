Team,

Thank you to all of you who have replied!

Lola has expressed the options nicely:

- Not on a weekend, and

- Either of:
    -- On a Friday, or
    -- One, but not both, of:
        --- On a Tuesday, xor
        --- Before 3:30pm

[ ~(weekend) ] ∧ [ (Friday) ∨ [ (Tuesday) ⊻ (Before 3:30pm) ] ]

I know also that there are exams some of us have on December 14 and
15, so December 13 to 15 including are probably not the best days to
hold the session.

All of you who have not answered yet, could you please tell me whether
you are interested in meeting up at any time noted above?

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Have a productive day!
