Team,

I am extremely grateful to all of you who have come today and made the
session productive.

It has been a pleasure to study in the environment full of initiative
and support. Thanks to all of you who have asked questions, dared to
be confused and took a risk of showing what and how they think in
front of a dozen of peers.

I hope you have found something useful in the session today. If not,
it would be great to hear what might have been done better. And the
suggestions of interesting topics or problems you may wish to add to
the agenda in the future are hugely welcomed!

Following the discussion of the Nested Interval Theorem, which turns
out to be a consequence of [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorsIntersectionTheorem.html][Cantor's Intersection Theorem]], here is the
problem from Spivak with which the Intermediate Value Theorem can be
proven differently from how it has been done in class:

---------------------------------------------

Suppose $$f$$ is continuous on $$[a, b]$$ and $$f(a) < 0 < f(b)$$.

Then either $$f(\frac{a + b}{2}) = 0$$,
or $$f$$ has different signs at the end points of $$[a, \frac{a+b}{2}]$$,
or $$f$$ has different signs at the end points of $$[\frac{a + b}{2}, b]$$.

Why?

If $$f(\frac{a + b}{2}) \neq 0$$, let $$I_1$$ be one of the two
intervals on which $$f$$ changes sign. Now bisect $$I_1$$. Either $$f$$
is $$0$$ at the midpoint, or $$f$$ changes sign on one of the two
intervals. Let $$I_2$$ be such an interval. Continue in this way, to
define $$I_n$$ for each $$n$$ (unless $$f$$ is $$0$$ at some
midpoint). Use the Nested Interval Theorem to find a point $$x$$ where
$$f(x) = 0$$.

---------------------------------------------

I hope you have a refreshing weekend.

Onwards!
