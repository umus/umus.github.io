Team,
</p>

<p>
I hope your exams are going well.
</p>

<p>
With all the activities, events and preparations, the most active
participants of our sessions have, there is a considerably lesser
number of us who will probably come to the session today.
</p>

<p>
If you are eager to meet, please drop me an email. Otherwise, there
are lots of other opportunities where you can spend your time.
</p>

<p>
For example, there is an introductory tutorial to P vs NP organised by
UofT Undegraduate Theory Group and given by Eric Bannatyne
(<a href="http://ericbannatyne.ca/">http://ericbannatyne.ca/</a>) in BA3116 from 14:00 to 15:00. Moreover,
there is a Putnam-style problem-solving session organised by Gal Gross
in BA4010 from 17:00 to 19:00.
</p>

<p>
Good luck to Lola, who sets off to a battle in a big winterguard
competition, and Thomas, grappling with MUN, and to each one of you.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
