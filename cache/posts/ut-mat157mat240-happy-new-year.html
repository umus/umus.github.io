<p>
Team,
</p>

<p>
Happy New Year!
</p>

<p>
I hope you have had a great break.
</p>

<p>
I also hope that we are ready to
continue our investigative climb.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow, on Friday 13, I suggest we
meet in BA1220 at 3 pm. Please note the
change of time and place &#x2013; it seems
that this room is the only one in Bahen
which suits our needs.
</p>

<p>
If you have any comments or suggestions,
please feel free to write me or reply to
all in order to make your message
visible to everyone.
</p>

<p>
If you also want to win special prizes
as most active participants, in order to
kickstart our seminar work, please
present some problems tomorrow which you
find exciting or (nota bene: not xor)
confusing and which you are eager to
grapple with during the session.
</p>

<p>
See you soon.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
