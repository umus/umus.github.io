<p>
Team,
</p>

<p>
I am very grateful to all of you who have come today for a series of
fascinating talks by Zachary Karry, Angela Wu and Calder
Morton-Ferguson (by the way, today, Saturday 15, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/calder.oakes">Calder</a>'s
birthday).
</p>

<p>
From <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160330-sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions/">the Leech lattice</a>, <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/TOPP/P57.html#Problem.57">Hadwider-Nelson</a> and beyond, there is a trove
of known and unknown results awaiting our attention.
</p>

<p>
There are also happy news: Lola Bradford, Phil Blakey and Jessica
(澄瑾) Liu have expressed their interest in joining our sessions.
</p>

<p>
I would be happy to hear any reflections, opinions and suggestions you
might have regarding today's talks or sessions in general. For
example, which talk today did you like most?
</p>

<p>
There are also updates on the ut.umu page for linear algebra, where
some resources from George M. Bergman and Terry Tao have been added,
all from the courses taught based on Friedberg et al.
</p>

<p>
I wish you a restful and productive weekend.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
