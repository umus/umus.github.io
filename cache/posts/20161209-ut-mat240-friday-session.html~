Team,
</p>

<p>
I hope you are having a productive exam period. For your interest,
there are past MAT240 exams from various sources published on the
<a href="https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1">ut.umu page</a> in the MAT240 Resources section.
</p>

<p>
With 3 people who have answered (thank you, Lola, Matthew and
Vanessa), I wonder if we wish to meet today, as usual, at 16:10 in
Bahen, B026 (seminar room), for a practice session.
</p>

<p>
Could you please tell me if this time suits you? Do you have any
suggestions, wishes or any secret longings regarding the session you
would like to share?
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
</p>

<p>
Good luck to all of you who have an exam today!
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
