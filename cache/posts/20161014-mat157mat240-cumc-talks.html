Team,
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all of you who have promptly reacted to the quick
questionnaire either in person or by mail.
</p>

<p>
Out of 6 of those who replied, 6 wish to go or at least <i>check out</i>
the talks.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at 16:30 in BA2135.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact me,
it would be extremely refreshing to hear what you think.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
