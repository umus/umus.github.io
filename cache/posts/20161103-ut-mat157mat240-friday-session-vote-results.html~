<p>
Team,
</p>

<p>
I am writing to inform you about the results of the questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
Out of 7 people whose responses I have received, 6 individuals have
confirmed their availability on Friday, and all of those 6 have chosen
the talks. Thus, the plan is to go to the talks.
</p>

<p>
Considering the last two days of exciting events in the Fields
Institute, I would be happy hear your opinions and reflections from
all of you who have managed to join the Bhargavalia. Moreover, if you
are really excited about all the mathemagic you have witnessed and
want to share the oumph with your knowledge-thirsty peers, we can
devote one of the next sessions, perhaps after the analysis midterm,
to your findings.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forwards to seeing you in BA2135 at 4:00 pm on Friday.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
