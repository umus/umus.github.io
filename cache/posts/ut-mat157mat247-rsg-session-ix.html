Team, 
</p>

<p>
I hope you have a wonderful last week of March!
</p>

<p>
Today the room BA3116 is free from 3 pm to 5 pm, so we can meet together and solve problems. 
</p>

<p>
Please note that this week the room is different!
</p>

<p>
Gal Gross is also going to have a session today in BA 4010 between 5-7
pm to continue working through Chapter 3 on Analysis in "Putnam
Beyond". He also hints that the problems we are going to look at may
be more challenging than usual.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
