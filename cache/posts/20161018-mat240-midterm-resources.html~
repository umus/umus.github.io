Team,
</p>

<p>
I hope you have had a productive and refreshing weekend, so
that tomorrow you get to grips and fully engage with the
midterm exam.
</p>

<p>
A table with the problems from Friedberg et al, recommended
by Professor Meinrenken since the beginning of the term, is
now up on the <a href="https://umus.github.io/ut-umu.html#sec-1-2-1">ut.umu page</a>.
</p>

<p>
You may also find the link to Terry Tao's LA course webpage
in the same section, where sample and actual midterms with
solutions are given.
</p>

<p>
I wish you good luck and lucid state of mind tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
