<p>
For all of you interested in doing some problems together, I suggest
we meet in BA4010 tomorrow at 15:00.
</p>

<p>
There is a Putnam Club running at 17:00 in the same room as well, so
we will finish by then and thus will have an opportunity to attend the
VI MUG talk, given by Dr. Brendan Kelly on  "How many ways to the coffee
house?".
</p>

<p>
"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems",- said
RÃ©nyi, so you might as well give a shot to the talk.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
