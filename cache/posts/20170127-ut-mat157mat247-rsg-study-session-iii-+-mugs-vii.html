Team,
</p>

<p>
!新年快乐
</p>

<p>
I hope you are still eager to plunge into some more problem solving.
</p>

<p>
I suggest we meet tomorrow at 15:00 in BA4010. Straight after our
session, at 17:00, there is a talk in BA1170 on meets and greets &#x2013;
ahem &#x2013; knots and graphs, given by Katie Walsh, for whom it is one of
the tests required to work at UofT. So we are lucky!
</p>

<p>
Hope to see you there.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
