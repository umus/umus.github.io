Team,
</p>

<p>
I am writing to remind you that we are planning to meet today at 16:10
in B026 (seminar room), Bahen.
</p>

<p>
As we have decided earlier, the session is going to be split into two,
one devoted to LA, and one to RA.
</p>

<p>
I would be extremely grateful if in the meantime you could think about
any questions you want to ask for the common discussion, any topics
you wish to be covered, and whether there is any material you are
willing to tell the group about.
</p>

<p>
For example, it would be exciting to learn from those of you who are
going through (have finished?) Baby Rudin and have studied Chapters
I-IV how our dear Walter treats continuity through metric spaces,
provided it is possible to compact the highly alluring lecture into
our time limits. Of course, it would be great to hear about any other
topic you find useful.
</p>

<p>
There are also updates to the MAT157 Resources section of the ut.umu
page, where the Companion Notes to PMA by Professor Evelyn Silvia have
been added.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to seeing you today.
</p>

<p>
Good luck to all of you who have a midterm today.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
