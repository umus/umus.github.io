Team,
</p>

<p>
Thank you to all of you who came last Friday. Even though we broke up
into two groups working in different rooms, I hope it was productive
for you. On my part, I am sorry if I failed to secure a good space for
us all &#x2013; the list of rooms showed that B026 was busy during our
session.
</p>

<p>
I am writing to elaborate on our plan of preparation for the final.
</p>

<p>
Since all the regular lectures are finished or going to be finished
this week, I wonder whether we want to organize joint preparation
sessions before December 17. I know that some people solve problems
together anyway, and I would be glad if we could join our efforts.
</p>

<p>
If you are up for the idea, could you please write me a short email
with the days and time periods you find suitable for meeting together?
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
