<p>
Team,
</p>

<p>
I hope you are having a productive week.
</p>

<p>
Today we plan to meet at 16:10 at an unusual place &#x2013; room 4010 in
Bahen.
</p>

<p>
I have also added a book on the treatment of linear algebra via
exterior products to the resource page on ut.umu.
</p>

<p>
If you know some interesting applications of MVT, intuitive
visualizations of dual spaces and stories about Diogenes and his
friends, you are more than welcome to share them with us.
</p>

<p>
Hope to see you there.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>

<p>
