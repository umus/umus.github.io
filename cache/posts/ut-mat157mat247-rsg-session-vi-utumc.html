Team, 
</p>

<p>
I hope you have had a wonderful week.
</p>

<p>
Since there is a math review session booked in 4010 today until
16:00, I suggest we meet at 15:00 in the undergraduate specialist
lounge on the 6th floor of Bahen &#x2013; there is a chalkboard and enough
space for 6 people. If there is a greater demand for space, we can
move to GB119, in which there is nothing scheduled today from 15:00.
</p>

<p>
There is also a concert of Indian classical music given by
Dr. Purnaprajna Bangere (<a href="https://www.purnaviolin.com/repertoire">web</a>page), a professor of mathematics and
music at University of Kansas, and others from 19:00 to 21:00 today
in the MacLeod Auditorium, Medical Sciences Building.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the seventeenth annual undergraduate mathematics competition
will be written on Sunday, March 12, beginning at 11 am, in
BA1170. Anyone can participate. If you are interested, please register
for the contest by sending an email to Professor Barbeau, at
barbeau@math.toronto.edu. Past papers are here:
