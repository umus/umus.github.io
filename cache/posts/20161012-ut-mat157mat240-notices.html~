<p>
Team,
</p>

<p>
I am writing to remind you that this Friday, October 14, we are going
to have our second meeting in B026(seminar room), Bahen, at 16:10.
</p>

<p>
There are several updates this week.
</p>

<p>
First, Yooveshen Mooroogen, who decided to join our sessions, has
suggested a list of recommended problems from Spivak as given in the
MAT157 syllabus of 2012-2013. The table adapted from the syllabus has
been published on the ut.umu page.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, ACE of UToronto got back to me about the request of
reserving B026 for our sessions. In order to have such a privilege, we
need to <a href="https://ulife.utoronto.ca/page/view/slug/apply">recognize our group with ULife</a> first. The exact procedure will
be investigated in detail after the midterms; there are several
options available. For example, we may try to collaborate with Math
Union. I will contact Angela shortly.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are several talks <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1609525922683111/">organized by the Math Union</a> at the
time of our meeting on Friday, from 16:30. The topics include the
following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Why Some Sequences are More Special than Others</i> by Calder
Morton-Ferguson
</li>

<li><i>The Chromatic Number of the Plane and the Axiom of Choice</i> by Angela Wu
</li>

<li><i>Sphere Packing and the Baffling Properties of the $$E_8$$ and Leech
Lattices</i> by Zachary Karry
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If there is any interest, I will find out whether this may count as an
academic experience in the context of CCR. If not, it sounds
interesting anyway. Please let me know what you think.
</p>

<p>
If you intend to come earlier than 16:10 on Friday, the schedule on
ACE for B026 shows that the room is going to be vacant after 15:00.
</p>

<p>
If you have any resources relevant to our agenda, for example lecture
outlines from any week, please let me know and I will post them on the
ut.umu page. Please also take a look at the MAT240 course page,
where several bonus problems have been already posted.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to seeing you on Friday.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
