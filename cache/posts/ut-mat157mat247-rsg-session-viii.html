Team, 
</p>

<p>
I hope you have had a wonderful week so far.
</p>

<p>
Today the room BA4010 is free from 3 pm to 5 pm, so we can meet
together and solve problems.
</p>

<p>
Gal Gross also organises the Putnam Session, which today is going to
focus on analysis from 5 pm to 7 pm. As Gal intriguingly says, "If you
wanted to attend the meetings but have been putting it off, waiting
for the "right moment" to join, this will be an excellent time to jump
in!".
</p>

<p>
With regards to the legendary VIth problem we have tried to solve in
the most recent session, you can learn more about the story behind it
and find hints and solutions here:
