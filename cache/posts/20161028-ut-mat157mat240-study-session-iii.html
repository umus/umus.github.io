Team,
</p>

<p>
I hope you have had a good night sleep so that you are ready for yet
another wonderful and productive Friday.
</p>

<p>
There are amazing news &#x2013; Shuting Zhang and Allan Chang have expressed
their interest in our sessions, and I hope they will be able to come
to today at 16:10, B026 (seminar room) in Bahen.
</p>

<p>
As always, it would be beneficial for the entire group if you could
think about questions you wish to ask during the session, any problems
you are curious about or any exciting mathematical adventures you have
been involved with that you can share with us.
</p>

<p>
Today, similarly to the last time, the preliminary plan is to split
the session into two parts, one devoted to analysis and one to linear
algebra, but there is room for any suggestions you might have.
</p>

<p>
I have also added some information to the ut.umu page about CCR that
you can receive by attending the sessions.
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
</p>

<p>
Onwards!
</p>
