Team,

<p>
I hope you are having a productive Friday.

With the exam period starting in its flare, it would be nice to hear if anyone of you want to get together and prepare for the exams. If you or your friends are up to some collective study session and want more people to join you, you can reply to all in this mailing list or write in any other medium you deem suitable.

There is another session with Gal Gross today in BA 4010 between 5-7pm with the aim to continue working through Chapter 3 of "Putnam and Beyond" on Analysis, if you want to diversify the questions in Spivak.
