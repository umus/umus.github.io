<i>The following are the suggestions and opinions from the participants</i>
<i>regarding the sessions</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The text is reproduced exactly as it has been received</i>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't interrupt when ppl talking , be polite, don't spend too much
time on one single question. Don't judge, don't copy but actually
know how to do the question. Be productive. Don't be too serious but
don't be too casual.
</li>

<li>Work through extra Spivak chapters, work through baby Rudin if we
are confident in our MAT157 material. I would also like to work on
MAT240 if everyone is okay with that because I'm less confident in
that material.
</li>

<li>Rule: Be prepared! Everybody should be familiar with the
material we are discussing. AND do not idle for more than 3
minutes. Itâ€™s time-killing and may distract other people.
</li>

<li>Topics Interested:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Course Materials, these things are fundamental.
</li>
<li>Further discussion based on Complex Numbers, e.g. Laurent expansion
</li>
<li>Number Theory, Probability, and much more.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I'm mostly interested reviewing the week's lectures and working on
relevant problems to cement our understanding of the material. Like
some of us mentioned tonight, I think questions from Spivak,
Prof. Meinrenken's bonus questions, and problem sets/tests from
previous years are good places to start. I'm open to looking at
other topics if other people are interested, but my primary concern
is mastery of the material at hand.
</li>

<li>I think it might be useful to identify our topics of discussion a
few days ahead of time so everyone has sufficient time to prepare
and come up with questions, discover areas of confusion, etc.
</li>

<li>We could also consider inviting one of the profs to a part of our
session sometime, since we're such a large group. They'd probably
appreciate the enthusiasm.
