* Recommendations

/The following are the recommendations received from various sources/
/with advice on the agenda and study of mathematics in general./

/The text is reproduced exactly as it has been received/.

20161104, *Özgür Esentepe*

Please note that Özgür may not be thinking the same way now.

- I recommend that you keep your notebooks, notes, books, assignments,
  thoughts from this year. Write down everything and save
  them. Actually this applies not only to mathematics. It is good to
  see how you improve as a math student and as a person throughout the
  years. Go back and read your writings in regular intervals (each
  month, every six months, every year etc.). You will realize you are
  actually improving. This helps keeping you sane. Because sometimes
  the math will be difficult and you will feel discouraged. These
  writings will remind you that you can try harder and get over the
  problems. Having said this, it is very important to realise that
  some materials will be difficult for some people and some materials
  will be easy for some people. There may be several reasons for
  this. You just need to invest enough times. One of the most
  important aspects of university education is this: After four years,
  you should be able to judge by yourself if you understood something
  well enough.

* Suggestions

/The following are the suggestions from the participants regarding/
/the sessions/.

/The text is reproduced exactly as it has been received/.

- Don't interrupt when ppl talking , be polite, don't spend too much
  time on one single question. Don't judge, don't copy but actually
  know how to do the question. Be productive. Don't be too serious but
  don't be too casual.

-  Work through extra Spivak chapters, work through baby Rudin if we
  are confident in our MAT157 material. I would also like to work on
  MAT240 if everyone is okay with that because I'm less confident in
  that material.

- Rule: Be prepared! Everybody should be familiar with the
  material we are discussing. AND do not idle for more than 3
  minutes. It’s time-killing and may distract other people.

- Topics Interested:
  + Course Materials, these things are fundamental.
  + Further discussion based on Complex Numbers, e.g. Laurent expansion
  + Number Theory, Probability, and much more.

- I'm mostly interested reviewing the week's lectures and working on
  relevant problems to cement our understanding of the material. Like
  some of us mentioned tonight, I think questions from Spivak,
  Prof. Meinrenken's bonus questions, and problem sets/tests from
  previous years are good places to start. I'm open to looking at
  other topics if other people are interested, but my primary concern
  is mastery of the material at hand.

- I think it might be useful to identify our topics of discussion a
  few days ahead of time so everyone has sufficient time to prepare
  and come up with questions, discover areas of confusion, etc.

- We could also consider inviting one of the profs to a part of our
  session sometime, since we're such a large group. They'd probably
  appreciate the enthusiasm.

- I expect the group to be organised. I also expect decent
  communication between the organisers and the members.

* Comments

** 20161014: CUMC Talks

  - I can't decide which talk I liked best! They were all great. I
    was especially impressed that i felt like i understood most of
    what they said. Which was deceptive, but still.

  - I had a really good time at the CUMC talks, I didn't really know
    what to expect going in. I've never gone to a talk not hosted by a
    professor, I was very happy with the talks.

    Zach's talk was excellently done, despite the topic being
    advanced(i.e. required a lot of mathematical machinery? A term I
    learned during the talk), but it addressed a question that was not
    difficult to understand. It's was really cool, and inspiring to
    see someone, who is not so different from me and my peers
    understand all this, and be able to give such a talk. Upon
    reflection, maybe this is the point of these talks, to give us a
    realistic role model as undergrads. Zach used a lot of cheesy
    audience participation stuff which ended up being great, didn't
    formally define the lattice which was a really good call, and as a
    result I found the progression of ideas easy to follow. I was
    interested the whole way through.

    Angela's was kind of crazy, she had a lot to say. I found the talk
    hard to follow, and honestly, I got lost a few times. The
    question(Hadwiger Nelson problem?) wasn't very clear to me, I
    still don't really understand what a colouring is, or what it
    means for a graph to be coloured. I ended up googling Moser's
    spindle during the talk because I had no idea why a construction
    like that could end up informing the problem. I think the source
    of the confusion was that I wasn't sure what we were trying to
    figure out, so I didn't see the motivation behind the steps that
    we were taking. In the end, the main point seemed to be that the
    axiom of choice was very powerful. I think there's a lot of people
    who would be very interested in the result she showed on the
    board, but it was all pretty meaningless to me. I felt mildly
    inspired to go home and read about ZFC and other things, but I
    don't really feel like I can explain to anyone else anything about
    either the hadwiger nelson or what the axiom of choice means. This
    is probably expected however, these aren't simple concepts, and
    time and my knowledge are limited, maybe I'm not in the intended
    audience of the talk (What's measure?).

    Calder's talk was hugely interesting to me, the death of a
    sequence joke was a great touch. I understood the motivation
    behind the problem, and while I got lost during the definition of
    the meta-fibonnaci sequence after he worked out a few of the terms
    on the chalkboard, I was back on track. I think above all else, it
    was COOL. I have a bit of history trying to read Hofstadter, and I
    thought the result was hugely unintuitive and therefore
    interesting (similarly, the leech lattice and e8 lattics? totally
    unexpected and interesting). There was a lot to think about, and I
    feel I can explain the topic to others. I thought this was great.

    General comments: It was nice to get some idea of what actually
    doing math looks like, what type of problems they try to solve
    (totally random ones!). The whole role model thing seemed to be a
    theme. The talks were definitely interesting, and were fun to talk
    about with non-math friends after. I think that Zach's talk was
    the best, and Calder's is the one which interested me most.
